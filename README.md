# ðŸ§  Support Vector Machines (SVM) Project

This project implements Support Vector Machines using Python and scikit-learn to predict whether a loan is **fully paid** or **not fully paid** based on borrower and loan characteristics.

- `02-Support Vector Machines Project.ipynb` â€“ Main Jupyter Notebook
- `README.md` â€“ Project summary and documentation

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset includes features like:

- `credit.policy` â€“ Does the customer meet the credit underwriting criteria?
- `int.rate` â€“ Interest rate of the loan
- `installment` â€“ Monthly payment owed by the borrower
- `log.annual.inc` â€“ Log-transformed annual income
- `purpose` â€“ Purpose of the loan (categorical)
- `fico` â€“ FICO credit score
- `not.fully.paid` â€“ Target variable (1 = Not fully paid, 0 = Fully paid)

---

## ðŸš€ Workflow Summary

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Identified missing values and categorical features
   - Plotted distributions and relationships

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Created dummy variables for `purpose`
   - Scaled numerical data if needed

3. **Model Training**
   - Used `SVC` from scikit-learn
   - Trained with default and tuned parameters

4. **Evaluation**
   - Used `confusion_matrix` and `classification_report`
   - Compared kernels (e.g., linear, rbf)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

- Countplots by loan status and purpose
- KDE plots for FICO scores
- Confusion matrices
- Jointplots showing interest rate vs. FICO

---

## ðŸ§  Insights & Observations

- ðŸ“‰ **FICO Scores Matter** â€“ Higher FICO scores are associated with fewer loan defaults.
- ðŸ’¸ **Interest Rates** â€“ Defaulted loans tend to have higher interest rates.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Loan Purpose** â€“ Certain loan types like small business or debt consolidation showed higher default rates.
- ðŸ§ª **Model Findings**:
  - SVM performed well but struggled slightly with class imbalance.
  - RBF kernel handled non-linear boundaries better than linear.
  - Hyperparameter tuning (especially `C` and `gamma`) improves performance.
